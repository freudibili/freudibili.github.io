# ReelToDo Privacy Policy

Last updated: {{ "now" | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

ReelToDo is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what information we (the ReelToDo app and site at `freudibili.github.io`) collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## Information we collect
- Information you provide directly, such as the content you add to your to-do lists or when you contact us for support.
- Basic app diagnostics and usage information that your device may provide automatically (e.g., device type, OS version, app version, and crash reports) to maintain and improve the app.

## How we use information
- Operate and improve ReelToDo features and performance.
- Respond to support requests and communicate important updates about the app.
- Protect the security and reliability of the service.

## What we do **not** do
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not use third-party advertising SDKs.
- We do not track you across other apps or websites.

## Data storage and retention
- Data you enter stays on your device and any platform services you choose to sync with (e.g., your cloud provider); we do not host your to-do content on our own servers.
- Diagnostic data (such as crash reports) may be handled by platform providers to help identify and fix issues.
- We retain contact/support communications only as long as needed to address your request.

## Sharing
- We may share limited information with service providers who help us operate the app (for example, crash analytics), under agreements that protect your information.
- We may disclose information if required by law, to respond to legal requests, or to protect users, the public, or our rights.

## Your choices
- You can delete to-do content directly in the app at any time.
- You can adjust device permissions (notifications, storage, etc.) in your system settings.
- You can contact us to request deletion of support communications that include your personal information.

## Children
ReelToDo is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
If we make material changes, we will update this page and adjust the “Last updated” date. Continued use of ReelToDo after changes means you accept the revised policy.
