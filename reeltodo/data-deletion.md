Follow these steps to delete your ReelToDo data:

1. **Delete your to-dos** in the app (swipe to remove items, or clear a list).
2. **Remove synced data** (if you enabled platform sync such as iCloud/Google Drive):
   - Open your platform's files or cloud settings and delete the `ReelToDo` folder or documents.
3. **Uninstall the app** from your device to remove local data.
4. **Delete support emails**: if you contacted us and want those messages removed, email [privacy@reeltodo.app](mailto:privacy@reeltodo.app) with the subject “Delete my ReelToDo support data.” We will confirm when deletion is complete unless we must retain information to comply with law.
